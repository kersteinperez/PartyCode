#PartyCode

PartyCode is a random fact generator for iOS devices, made with swift and xcode. On click, a random fact is pulled from an array and rendered on the page, as well as a random background color. The facts are about coding, programming languages, software development parties (political, social, real and fake). The idea of PartyCode was inspired by my time in WDI-Bacon, at General Assembly NYC.

##Instructions
Open app in xcode, run on simulator or plugged in device. Launch screen will appear quickly, and a random fact against a random background will render. For a new fact and background color, simply click button "Party On, Code".

##Technologies Used
- swift v. 2.1.1
- xcode v. 7.2
- ios 9.2

##Approach
Without any experience developing in swift, I used psuedo code first. Planning a random fact generator, I realized I would need certain functions and features. I knew I'd need a button with an on-click function, an array to pull facts, and randomly rendered background colors -- I used the documentation, tutorials and youtube videos to learn how to do so in xcode and swift.
